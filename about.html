                <h3>How long have you been running Green Knight?</h3>
                <p>I started Green knight in high school in 1980, I landscaped all throughout college. I studied landscape architecture
                    and business at The University of Washington</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Where does the name come from?</h3>
                <p>When I was in high school I had a business partner Chris Vasco. Our high school mascot were the kings knights.
                    we started with the name Green Thumb then realized there were hundreds of green thumbs in the industry.
                    we were joking around with a bunch of different green names and finally settled on green knight </p>

                <h3>What sets Green Knight apart?</h3>
                <p>Our creativity, and our longevity, we have developed unique style and a different way of looking at landscapes.
                    We have tried everything from asian, to contemporary, to english. we actually listen to what a client
                    wants and put our own unique twist. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>How is Green Knight involved in the community?</h3>
                <p> I was on the Kirkland design review board for 8 years, serving as chairman for 1 year. we have done volunteer
                    projects like the front of the Kirkland library, and I try to employ directly out of the Kirkland area,
                    I have tried my hardest to make Kirkland beautiful. We also participate in plant sales at both Kirkland
                    farmers markets, helping to developing relationships with local home owners. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>How broad is your landscape design experience? </h3>
                <p>We have experimented with everything, we donâ€™t limit to one style of landscaping. this allows us to be broad
                    and knowledgable to many styles. We also observe what other designers are doing to see what is effective
                    and ineffective. we are continuing to hone our style, even 30 years into the business.</p>
